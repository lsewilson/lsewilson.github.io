											<p>Movebubble is making renting easier for the Renter as well as more transparent. We have two apps: one of those we call the renter app, which is the public face of the company where people wanting to rent in London can search for property, arrange viewings, and ultimately make an offer.</p>

                                            <p>The second app is for Movebubble Partners, Negotiators working on the ground to let homes to our renters. It picks up from the Renter app and communicates viewing requests to the negotiator in the partner agency offices. It also facilitates two way chat communication between Renter and Negotiator and processing of incoming offers.</p>
											<p>As a Movebubble developer, I've worked across the full stack, delivering features in both apps and the back end. </p>
