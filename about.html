									<p>Hi there! I'm Laura <span class="icon fa fa-smile-o"/> </p>
									<p>Currently, you'll find me working on our apps at <a href="http://www.movebubble.com/">Movebubble</a>, a London-based PropTech start up, where we're on a mission to make renting easier in the city!</p>
									<p>I've been in software development since Summer 2016, when I started learning to code at <a href="/">Makers Academy</a>. You can read about my journey learning to code in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, which I started to document my progress through the course.</p>

									<p>These are some of the languages and tech that I've picked up and like to play around with:</p>

									<p><strong>ReactJS | React Native | Javascript | Ruby-on-Rails | C# | PostgreSQL | MongoDB</strong></p>
									<p> When I'm not tapping away at my Macbook, you might find me riding my bike, baking in the kitchen or practising yoga to stretch out after a long day.</p>
									Feel free to connect with me on social media using the links below <span class="icon fa fa-smile-o"/>
