										<h3>Hi there!</h3>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Laura and Iâ€™m a driven and enthusiastic full stack developer.</p>
									<p>You can find me at Movebubble, a London-based PropTech start up, where we're on a mission to make renting easier in the city.
                                        I work across two mobile apps 
                                    </p>
									<p>Prior to this, I used to work as in... dare I say it? Investment banking. It took two years before I realised I wasn't fooling anyone, myself included, into thinking I found it interesting. Eager to learn a skill for the modern age, I enrolled at Makers Academy, a coding bootcamp and became a developer. </p>
                                    <p>When I'm not tapping away at my Macbook, you might find me on my bike, baking in the kitchen or practising yoga to stretch out after a long day.</p>
