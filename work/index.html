											<p>Movebubble is making renting a home easier, as well as more transparent. We have two apps: one of those we call the Renter App, which is the public face of the company where people wanting to rent in London can search for properties, arrange viewings, and ultimately make an offer on a property.</p>
											<p>The second app is for Movebubble Partners, letting agents working on the ground to find homes for our renters. It picks up from the Renter app and communicates viewing requests to the agent in the partner offices. It also facilitates two way chat communication between renter and agent and processing of incoming offers.</p>
											<p>As a Movebubble developer, I've worked across the full stack, delivering features in both apps and the back end. </p>
